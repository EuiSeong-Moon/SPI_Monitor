# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for the SPI Monitoring Driver, a Linux kernel driver developed for ARM64 Android devices (e.g., Samsung Galaxy). This driver aims to monitor SPI communication for the purpose of identifying security weaknesses and supporting threat modeling activities by security teams.

### 1.2 Scope
The SPI Monitoring Driver will:
- Monitor all SPI communication between kernel-level drivers and hardware peripherals.
- Provide logging and reporting capabilities to support vulnerability analysis.
- Be deployable on rooted Samsung Galaxy devices with ARM64 architecture.

Optional functionality includes monitoring other types of communication drivers (e.g., I2C, UART).

### 1.5 Overview
This document provides a full specification for the SPI Monitoring Driver, including system context, user needs, specific functional/non-functional requirements, and assumptions.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The SPI Monitoring Driver will be an independent kernel module, not altering existing driver logic but passively observing SPI communications via hook mechanisms or instrumentation.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Intercepts and logs data transmitted and received over the SPI bus.
- Identifies anomalies or potential vulnerabilities in SPI usage patterns.
- Generates monitoring reports for offline analysis.
- [Optional] Extensible to support other bus systems.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

| User Class | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Security Engineer | Uses the output of the monitoring driver for threat modeling and vulnerability detection. Familiar with kernel-level logs. |

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Android 10+ on Samsung Galaxy devices
- ARM64 kernel (v4.x+)
- Root access enabled
- SELinux set to permissive or properly configured for the driver

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must not introduce noticeable performance degradation.
- Must ensure system stability; kernel panics must be avoided.
- Must comply with Android driver module standards.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The device is rooted and accessible with administrative permissions.
- The target device uses SPI-compatible hardware with existing SPI drivers.
- Developers have access to kernel headers and build tools for cross-compilation.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: The system shall capture all incoming and outgoing SPI transactions at the kernel level.
- **FR2**: The system shall log the timestamp, device node, and data payload of each SPI transaction.
- **FR3**: The system shall allow enabling/disabling monitoring dynamically via ioctl or procfs/sysfs interface.
- **FR4**: The system shall generate periodic reports summarizing SPI usage and anomalies.
- **FR5**: *[Optional]* The system shall support monitoring additional interfaces (e.g., I2C, UART).

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: The system shall not interfere with the normal functioning of SPI communication.
- **NFR2**: Testable via stress/fuzz testing. Good.

### 3.3 Interface Requirements
- **UIR1**: The system shall allow user-space tools to query logs or configure settings.
